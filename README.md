# Number to Words Converter 📝🔢

A simple yet effective Python program that converts numbers into their textual representation.  
For example, `123` → `"one hundred and twenty-three"`.

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Supports numbers from `1` to `9999` (easily extendable)  
✅ Displays both numerical and textual formats  
✅ Handles invalid inputs gracefully  
✅ Well-structured, modular, and easy to read code  

## 📦 Installation & Usage  
Simply run the script with Python:  
```sh
python number_to_word.py
```

## 🔧 How It Works  
- Uses **integer division (`//`) and modulus (`%`)** to extract digits  
- Implements **dictionaries** for efficient mapping  
- Modular design for **readability and maintainability**  
- Handles **special cases** like numbers between 10-19 separately  

## 🎯 Why This Project?  
This project is great for:  
✔ Learning **input handling and error management** in Python  
✔ Understanding **data structures (dictionaries)**  
✔ Practicing **clean and modular coding principles**
